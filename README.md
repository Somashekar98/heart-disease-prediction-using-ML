REQUIREMENTS:
first you need to have jupyter note book or else you can run this in google colab or any other oline notebook.
python language should be known.
1.matplotlib
2.panda
3.CSV
4.stats
5.dataframes
6.data visulisation

FEATURES SELECTION:
1.age
2.gender
3.chest pain
4.blood presure
5.arm pain
6.food routine

..etc

DATASET:
the data set used in this project collected from kaggle website or else you can collect data through hospitals also.
heart.csv file dowloaded from kaggle site.

ACCURACY:
we can achieve 80 to 99% of accuracy using Knn and decission tree algorithm. we can use other ML algorithm also like, random forest,SVM,naive baise.

LANGUAGE:
python language 100%

HOW TO RUN CODE:
WE can use jupyter online or offline or google colab

ABOUT PROJECT:
heart disease is one of the major problem in humans today, beacuse of our daily routine and tension, presure,food, everything matters here for this disease.
early detection of this disease can solve easily, but mannually checking is take too much of time and cost. in healthcare industry today allmost are using AI, deep learning and  machine learing. this techniques helps to reduce the cost and time for both patients and doctors. using some features we can predict the disease.
